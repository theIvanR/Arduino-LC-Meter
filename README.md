# Arduino-LC-Meter
A functional LC meter based on an Arduino board

Here is a code for a truly self contained arduino LC meter that uses no active external parts and is capable of rudimentary internal calibration

How to wire? 

  Barebones Configuration: 
  ->Pin 11: Pulse pin  
  ->Pin 7: GND reference for internal compartor   
  ->Pin 6: HIGH input for internal compartor  
 
  ->Pin A5: Mode Selection pin
  
  ->Pin A2: Autoranging Capacitor Positive test pin  
  ->Pin A1: Autoranging Capacitor Negative pin
